# WelcomeToProgramming
Let's make this repo an experience sharing BLOG-like-thing where we will share our experiences of getting stucked or encountering errors as beginner (new programmer) (self solved or solved by frnd in inbox)


## KaziRifatMorshed
- we may get an error to compile a `.c` file with GCC if it contains `#include "math.h"` in UNIX(simply, Linux) operating system. Add `-lm` at the last of the command (which will look like this: `gcc -o abcxyz abcxyz.c -lm`, otherwise, the GCC compiler may fail to link math.h header file
- avoid `conio.h` , the latest GCC gives errors, forget it (so avoid `getch()` )
- use `C/C++ Compile Run` Extension (extension id: danielpinto8zz6.c-cpp-compile-run ) for VS-Code or VScode like IDE (like: OSS Code or VS COdium) , use keyboard shortcut F6 ; if you are interested to compile in GNU/Linux terminal, you may follow [this link](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa09/cse141/tutorial_gcc_gdb.html) 
- It is a bad practice to use the goto statement of C, a teacher suggested, avoiding it
- Online Judges are Stupid/idiot/baka.... itai ....

## IbnulAbrarShahriarSeam
- Read the problem statement carefully.
- Try to find a mathematical solution rather than using a loop. Loops take a huge amount of time and memory to execute. A mathematical solution is almost always more efficient.
- If you are working with an integer-type variable, try not to use something that returns double or floating-point values (e.g., pow()). As it may result in unexpected behavior.

## sharafat
- At first I just used to read and read without practicing. Which is definitely a bad habit!
- How are you supposed to learn a software if you're afraid of an unknown button? This philosophy of mine both helped and got me into a tons of troubles.
