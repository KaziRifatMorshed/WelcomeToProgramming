Read problem statement correctly
Try to find mathematical solution rather than using loop. As loops take huge time and memory to execute. Mathematical solution is almost always more efficient.
If you are working with integer type variable, try not to use something that returns double or floating point values (Eg. pow()). As it may result in unexpected behaviour.
