Read the problem statement carefully.
Try to find a mathematical solution rather than using a loop. Loops take a huge amount of time and memory to execute. A mathematical solution is almost always more efficient.
If you are working with an integer-type variable, try not to use something that returns double or floating-point values (e.g., pow()). As it may result in unexpected behavior.
